Rebuilding Wordle (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) with some added features like the ability to play unlimited games in a day and trying 6 letter words.

This app was developed as a side project for my portfolio. Since it won't be maintained forever, I figured it would be irresponsible to store any sensitive data so only a username is used to sign up. By omitting the email address there isn't a way to verify a password reset so I removed the ability.

Usernames must be unique. If you choose to play without a username all analytics will be stored locally so you will only be able to access it from the browser you are currently using.
